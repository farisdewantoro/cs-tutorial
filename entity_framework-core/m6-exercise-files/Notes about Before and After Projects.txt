WPF:
The demo is not a true walk through, but it does have a "before" state which is what I'm showing you that's been added to the model. Keep in mind that I do not step through getting from before to after.
The "after" has the full solution with both the samurai and battle windows implemented.

UWP:
There is no "before" solution for the EF Core UWP app because in the demo, this app was created from scratch.
Also, please keep in mind that UWP apps can only be developed and run on Windows 10 machines.
